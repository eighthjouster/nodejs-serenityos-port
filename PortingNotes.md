Compiler conditionals used so far:

_ENABLE_MUTEXES
_ENABLE_LC_MESSAGES
_SIGNBIT_NATIVE_DEFINED
_ENABLE_GETADDRINFO_FLAGS
__ENABLED_MSG_PEEK
_OS_SERENITY_ENABLE_DLINFO
_OS_SERENITY_ENABLE_OSYNC
_SERENITY_OS_FD_READDIR_SUPPORTED

Each one of these must be set to true, 1, or simply defined, when the functionality they are providing is natively implemented in SerenityOS.
